# Circle (Creator of USDC stablecoin) Case Study

## Overview and Origin
This case study is on the company Circle and around its main product, the USDC stable coin, for which it is most widely known for.
Circle was founded in October 2013, by Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville, and began as a consumer peer-to-peer cryptocurrency payments and exchange platform.
The company stopped offering its cryptocurrency wallet services in 2016 abd announced that the Circle Pay mobile and related web apps would be discontinued in 2019.
In 2020, the company stated that its focus will be on its USDC stablecoin, which is the main topic of interest for this case study.

Circle as received $270 million in venture backing from investors including Accel Partners, Bitmain, Blockchain Capital, Breyer Capital, CICC Alpha, China Everbright Bank, Digital Currency Group, General Catalyst, IDG Capital, and Pantera. 

The idea of a stablecoin arose with the rise of cryptocurrency trading. As many cryptocurrencies have volitile price flucuations, having a cryptocurrency that remains stable relative to a fiat currency is desirable for trading and holding purposes. USDC is the largest stablecoin that is regulated and claims to be "backed by fully reserved assets, redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars". 

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The company's main focus is  the enablement for "businesses of all sizes to harness the power of digital currencies and public blockchains for payments, commerce and financial applications worldwide". It provides payment and accounting systems to integrate the use of USDC stablecoin to applications and charges a subscription fee for processing transactions which is comparable to companies such as PayPal, Stripe, or other payment gateways.
The unique advantage of Circle's payment system and USDC is the arguably lower transaction fees since the USDC stablecoin runs on top of decentralized blockchain technlogies (Ethereum, Tron, Algorand, and Solana) and can bypass traditional banking transfer systems such as the international transfer system SWIFT, which is slow and costly. The transaction fee is not nil however, as the blockchain solutions usually charge a "gas" fee to compensate miners and other stakeholders of the system (in the case of Ethereum for example). Speed is also an advantage of USDC as the transaction time is usually only a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the underlying blockchain technology. SWIFT usually takes several days and so does legacy interbank transfer channels used in the United States.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
held in reserve, or by other "approved investments"

According to the Circle website, USDC is available as Ethereum ERC-20,  Algorand ASA, Solana SPL, and TRON TRC-20 tokens and supports smart contracts.
According to an article on coindesk.com, 61% of USDC tokens are backed by “cash and cash equivalents”, 13% by term deposits in non-US banks, and 12% are in U.S. Treasuries account for 12% with 9% in commercial paper accounts, and the remaining tokens are backed by municipal and corporate bonds.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Circle and USDC are competing in a wide variety of areas within the finiancial industry including payment gateways, transfer systems, banking institutions, and even fiat currencies themselves. 
Other large noticable stable coins include USDT (Tether), BUSD (Binance USD), and DAI (a decentralised stablecoin).
USDT is actually the stablecoin with the largest market cap ($64 billion USD as of 18/08/2021) but some have doubts as to whether the stablecoin is fully backed by its equivalent in assets. Therefore it has been deemed more risky than USDC which has greater compliance with regulations and authorities. BUSD is issued by Binance and has a market cap of $12 billion USD (as of 18/08/2021) and was created mainly to facilitate trade on its widely popular crypto-trading platform, which is the largest in the world.  

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Being a regulated stablecoin and one that has played by the rules so far, it has been recognized for its legitamacy and even Mastercard and Visa, two giant's in the space and arguably also competitors to Circle and USDC, have agreed to use USDC to settle payments.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations
Some advise for the company I would give would include 

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
